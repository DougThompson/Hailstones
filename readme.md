# Hailstones - The 3n+1 Problem #

## Overview ##
**Hailstones** is a simple application to play with the 3n+1 or [Collatz Problem at Wolfram](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CollatzProblem.html) or [Collatz conjecture at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).

The rules are simple:

1. Choose a starting number
2. If the number is even, divide it by 2
3. If the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1
4. Repeat the process #2 & #3 until the 4-2-1 loop is reached

## Development Requirements ##
Visual Studio 2010, C#, .NET Framework 4.0.
